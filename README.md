> Script táº¡o server Minecraft Java


Minecraft Server [setup](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Setting_up_a_server) script for Windows, MacOSX, Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Fedora... (Not Solaris at the moment)

### Installation and using
For Windows there's an executable available at [Releases](https://github.com/hoangtheboss/mc-server-script/releases)

Alternatively you can use the command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/HoangTheBoss/mc-server-script.git
# cd into the repo
pip -r requirements.txt
python makeserver.py
```

### I want to run my own MC server but don't have a dedicated server for that
You can host your server at [Apex Hosting](https://billing.apexminecrafthosting.com/aff.php?aff=2786) for cheap!
